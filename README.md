# Danish and English theory models:

If memory, logic and senses were put in a set like a half bubble. And if structure, thought, feeling and intelligence in this sequence were put in a set and interconnected in the sequence called F L O W and diagonal not named and additionally between the named connections/links. And if sequence, plan and action were put in a set interconnected making a triangle. And if from high to low order making a stair The, perspective and momentum were put in a set. And if in a half box where top has link and bottom difference were a set. Would all these sets then not make a puzzle of the consciousness, which when solved then be able to change a persons psychosis?

By giving personalized codes, that could be used to sort thoughts, events and more like states, to then after changing it's meaning with different codes, which could be anything from objects to non-objects with any kind of pattern and combination, like for example personalized codes as numbers with different meanings for a paranoid schizophrenia:

0: group, company, off, zero, null or organization.

1: yes, single, no, person, negative, positive, on, one or first.

2: yes, no, positive, negative, couple, two, second or after 

3: order, police, military, agency, family, three, holy, intelligence or informer.

4: negative, criminal, unholy, four, mafia, cartel or gang.

5: handicap, five, espionage, spy or intel.

6: unholy, six, satanist, demon, terror, killer, terrorist or weapons.

7: lucky, seven or holy.

8: mafia, cartel, syndicate, other criminal organization or eight.

9: threat, weapon, spy or nine.


Combine numbers and it gets a meaning in context. 

The person would at some time think in codes and organize by looking, moving or saying.
At some time the person if the person keeps going, the person would then like to do something.

If neccesary get other people involved, from friends to psychologists or therapist. By changing the pattern, symptoms gets easier to notice and react, also make proactive choices.

Make it to a game, it could be mental to conversations or roleplays.


# For comfort:

![English visual comfort structure model](https://github.com/DearestDreamWish/Psychosis-Cure/blob/main/effect%20affect%20titel.png)

+ Touch: Touch your own skin if possible like the hand.
+ Acupunture: Pressure places like described online for different reasons.
+ Breathing: Focus on breathing until you have calmed yourself.


If you have marbled skin it can be a sign for being scared and may even have dissociations, because you do not recognize such feelings.

If you have suddenly a lot of saliva in your mouth, it can be a sign for mental disturbances.

If you are easily shocked, it can be a sign of dissociation.

It's important that the person develops a comfort zone and from there expands it on own pace.

# For understanding:

+ All the psychic can be stored differently with the will or control. Discipline can help. This technique can be used to repair damage.

+ When the brain is in a conflict with something external then the brain tries to calm itself in something experienced, whatever it has experienced can make itself calm even something things, that the person dislikes. It's like falling back or having a backup.

+ Avoidance technique: Stop the drama, be calm. Prevent the development of brain drama. If it's not possible to stop it, then analyze it and problem solve it.

+ Brain breaking: If you miss something important in an important situation, forget something important or remember several things at the same time in a disorganized way.

+ If you are in doubt and have to choose, the brain can be "split". The greater the stress, the greater the division. The more choices, the more divisions.

+ Mind's eye: The mental faculty of conceiving imaginary or recollected scenes. 

+ Verbal working memory system. 

+ Synesthesia: Distinct from neuroscience, the concept of synesthesia in the arts is regarded as the simultaneous perception of multiple stimuli in one gestalt experience. Is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway. 

+ Mind wandering: A condition in which thoughts do not remain focused on the task at hand but range widely and spontaneously across other topics.

+ Jaak Panksepp carved out seven biologically inherited primary affective systems called SEEKING (expectancy), FEAR (anxiety), RAGE (anger), LUST (sexual excitement), CARE (nurturance), PANIC/GRIEF (sadness), and PLAY (social joy). He proposed what is known as "core-SELF" to be generating these affects.

+ Sensation is input about the physical world obtained by our sensory receptors and sent to the brain through the nervous system. Perception is the process by which the brain selects, organizes, and interprets these sensations.

+ While your conscious mind – i.e. the part of your brain that you can control with your will and your act in action – can pick up and interpret approximately 40 stimuli from the environment per second, the subconscious mind processes 20 million stimuli in  the second. Your subconscious mind is therefore an extremely powerful information processor, and it observes both the outside world and the body's internal signals, reads the environment's signals and makes use of previously learned information - all without help, monitoring or attention from the  conscious mind.

+ Neuro-linguistic programming.

# Games:

+ Guess what I can and know: you say what you are, the opponent must also guess what you can and know, points for each mentioned skill or knowledge. Something new is drawn from a collection of self-made pieces of paper with text that says what you are. After the opponent's guess, the roles are changed.

+ Guess which science: one mentions something, and the other has to guess which science was used, or can be used for the mentioned. You may use the internet and you may ask others. Points are awarded for each correct science mentioned to the guesser. If guessed incorrectly, points are given for each incorrect science to the asker. If there was no guess in the round, points are also given to the asker. The roles are changed after the points are awarded.

+ Analyze works: one chooses a work, and the other must describe and talk about the work. For each descriptive word or phrase for the story, one point is given. If something is described or told that can be said to be incorrect, one point is given for each incorrect sentence or word to the asker. The roles are changed after the points are awarded.

For each correct descriptive word for the reaction made by the guesser, points are awarded to the guesser. For each incorrect descriptive word for the reaction made by the guesser, points are given to the reaction maker. One point is given to the reaction maker if the guess is incorrect. The roles are changed after points are awarded.

+ Guess the situation: one tells a story and the other has to explain the situation. If a good explanation is given, a point is given to the person who explained. If there is no explanation or the explanation is poor, one point is given to the narrator. The roles are changed after the points are awarded.

+ Tell the feeling: one person names a feeling and the other has to explain the feeling and describe how it feels. One point is given to the explainer, if the explainer tells how to get the feeling and another point for the description. If it is not explained or if it is not really true what was explained, points are given to the asker. If the feeling is not named or the feeling is named incorrectly, points are given to the opponent. The roles are changed after two points.

+ Guess the message for the situation: one tells a situation and the other has to give a message for the situation that makes sense before a minute after the story is finished and it was said "The story is finished". Points are given to the narrator if the time runs out and no message was said, otherwise a point is given to the message giver. The roles are changed after each point.

+ Give me a feeling and discuss with me: one must try to give a feeling and the feeling reciever must discuss until the feeling changes. If the feeling changes, one point is given to the one with the given feeling, even if no feeling was given before 10 seconds from the start. The emotion giver gets one point, if the emotion is not changed before 20 seconds from the start. You switch roles after each point.

+ Make it easier: one tells a story in detail and the other has to guess what can be improved or what can be made easier with explanation. Points are given according to how many improvements are explained, if no improvement is explained, a point is given to the storyteller. The roles are changed after the points are awarded.

+ What to do: one tells a story or situation and the other has to explain what to do. Points are awarded for each correct option mentioned to the explainer.
