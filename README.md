If memory, logic and senses were put in a set like a half bubble. And if structure, thought, feeling and intelligence in this sequence were put in a set and interconnected in the sequence called F L O W and diagonal not named and additionally between the named connections/links. And if sequence, plan and action were put in a set interconnected making a triangle. And if from high to low order making a stair The, perspective and momentum were put in a set. And if in a half box where top has link and bottom difference were a set. Would all these sets then not make a puzzle of the consciousness, which when solved then be able to change a persons psychosis?

By giving personalized code, like as example if paranoid schizophrenia:
0 group, company, off, zero, null or organization.

1 yes, single, no, uerson, negative, positive, on, one or first.

2 yes, no, positive, negative, couple, two, second or after 3 order, police, military, agency, family, three, holy, intelligence or informer.

4 negative, criminal, unholy, four, mafia, cartel or gang.

5 handicap, five, espionage, spy or intel.

6 unholy, six, satanist, demon, terror, killer, terrorist or weapons.

7 lucky, seven or holy.

8 mafia, cartel, syndicate, other criminal organization or eight.

9 threat, weapon, spy or nine Combine numbers and it gets a meaning in context.

The person would at some time think in codes and organize by looking, moving or saying.
At some time the person if the person keeps going, would like to something.

Also: All the psychic can be stored differently with the will or control. Discipline can help. This technique can be used to repair damage.

When the brain is in a conflict with something external then the brain tries to calm itself in something experienced, whatever it has experienced can make itself calm even ironic things. It's like falling back or having a backup.

Avoidance technique: Stop the drama, be calm. Prevent the development of brain drama. If it's not possible to stop it, then analyze it and problem solve it.

Brain breaking. If you miss something important in an important situation, forget something important or remember several things at the same time in a disorganized way.

If you are in doubt and have to choose, the brain can be "split". The greater the stress, the greater the division. The more choices, the more divisions.

If neccesary get other people involved, from friends to psychologists or therapist. By changing the pattern, symptoms gets easier to notice and react, also make proactive choices.


Motivational things:


Every problem has solutions, work from inside to outside. Don't undermine or think short about others or yourself. Your childhood can be changed in memory and so your subconscious mind. Momentary emotions are normal but long lasting emotions are not normal. Don't carry your sufferings. Situations happens but it's the mind that thinks that it's either bad or good dependent of feelings. The mind can think that it's not possible to overcome big problems. Even though it is possible. Overcome these fears. Stop blaming external reasons. Create a new reality by using your strengths and talents. Be aware of negative thoughts. Commit to yourself that you will improve skills, capabilities and abilities. Everything and everyone has a purpose so do you, fulfil it. Be open minded and embrace everything that's positive. Your life is a journey and self esteem is a positive experience. Believe that your inner self is aware of the positive in you. Confidence leads to accomplishments and reversed too. Life is what you create now and not what has happened. Success can also be defined by inner peace. Commit to having an optismistic perspective in every sitaution. Define your qualities to gain a positive self image. Your existence has great value. The positive self is not dependent by anything external. Remember that you are good. Goodness from you positively affects others. Acknowledge your good side and what is positive. Lavt selvværd er en manifestation af negative tanker. Low self esteem is a manifestation of negative thoughts. Keep your power in the good part of your mind. Low self esteem is created by your own mind. Be constructive about everything. Keep positive thought patterns active in the deep subconscious mind. Live with positive thoughts. Keep positive thoughts. Your confidence affects others positively. Remember that you are a good person, with good values. Be confident. Trust and be loyal to yourself. You have a meaningful existence. Always have a good imagination for visions. Belief yourself and take actions against all odds. Stop people commenting on your life. Don't think about negative comments. Prove yourself to yourself. Don't focus on weaknesses or negatives. Focus on fixing them. Be careful and don't self reject, because of anything. Don't blame yourself for everything. Don't be negative about it, create instead. Think about what impact is pursuing this goal likely to have on my time? What else could suffer the consequences of my divided attention if I commit to this pursuit? In what ways does this effort compliment (or detract from) my grandest life vision? Balance is key for fulfilment in life. Everything has processes. Every thing takes time. The energy is limited every day, so focus on what is important. To get something in an area of your life it costs in another area of your life. Be rememorable. Show honor. Remember the subjective part. Carefully interact. Don't regret, learn from mistakes. Be more than an idea man. Don't be emotionless. Feel emotions and correct them if a mistake has happened. Be reasonable and logical with being objective and subjective. Be calm and listen carefully. Personal success is defined by the process and not the outcome. Make goals which you are inspired to do. Focus on creating tomorrow. What do you love. What are you good at. What the world needs. What can you be paid for. All four combined gives the ideal lifestyle. Do something you love, which also gives external value. Pursuit a purposeful end. If you can't control and you question your emotions it then leads to disobedience towards own intentions. Stress can be reduce the consciousness level. Your consciousness can observe thoughts. A thought can trigger responses, thoughts and emotions. External greater goals can give transcendence. Define your ideal and live by it. Passion, frustration and purpose makes a vision. Reflect on hardship and life experiences. Have clear visions. What ambition is prioritized? Secure internal motivations. Deep self awareness creates a greater mind. What didn't kill me makes me stronger. Hardships can also take direction if allowed, so focus. You can think independently or dependently by the external. Use the past to understand and make a new pathway, which direction I should focus on. People sayings aren't always true. Progress happens when you focus on something rewarding or meaningful. Be considered, because all have a history. Everything applies at the same time, so it's about what you focus on that's important. Gibbs reflective model: 1 Description: what happened? 2 Feelings: what were you thinking and feeling? 3 Evaluation: what was good and bad about the experience? 4 Analysis: what sense can you make of the situation? 5 Conclusion: what else could I have done? 6 Action plan: if it arose again what would you do? What and who is your time worth? Practice in analyzing the contra. Disciplin and self control are the keys for focus. Compare priorities from before and now. Follow your good principles. Be aware that your mind has been wandered and distracted to then get back to focus with any recall method. Jige jige technique: shake head so mouth makes a sound. Where would you benefit the most from your own mind being right now? You can remain focused as long as you can be disciplined. Thoughts are something we either focus on or don't. Just because you think it, it doesn't mean that it exists. What is influencing you right now? Where are you focused on right now? Where is your mind right now? Where's your body right now? Set a path for a vision. How will I impact myself, others, the bigger picture and last those who's close to me. The attitude can have an affect and an effect on the atmosphere. Count the potentiel cost for action and adaption for attitude. In every situation what you can control is your attitude or action. Always develop and grow or else others will take the opportunities. Be a winner. Take the winner mentality with you everywhere. Take calculated risks. Only I am to blame not my destiny. I choose where I want to be. Only I choose for myself. You have a free will. Commit to a path not a future. Appreciate and focus on what you have than looking into a distant future. Intentions must be clear. My perspective is not the same as others, so be careful with the words. Don't expect to not be dissapointed. Focus on the opportunity and outcome of a challenge and not the challenge. Always apply the knowledge. Always relate the knowledge to your real life. Detach learned helplessness. Monitor results & tasks to determine productivity, value and efficiency. Predict output and outcomes and decide if it's worth pursuing. Determine and eliminate any unnecessary risks. Qualify the objectives to know the cost. Establish the most creative way of delivering prerequisites. Define prerequisites for what success would be. Define main goals and determine the best main goal. Goals aren't everything. Don't be crushed if you can't right now. Be disciplined to complete a smart goal. Disconnect from the negative consciousness to then connect to the positive. Always have a vision, hope and purpose. Be disciplined, productive and focus on what you own and can do to be what you want to be. Be grateful and careful with money. Appreciate money. Make progress in every area. Make use of what you have. Beliefs are just ideas. Focus on one thing at a time. Focus on what you have first, where you are and then build for the future. You start with one corner and continue with the next until you have a foundation. The foundation is important. If it is important to me or someone I love, then keep it otherwise drop it. Be more interested in others. Be social. Make friendships. There is hope for a good life. Enjoy life. Your longing for love is your drive and must be recognized and not suppressed. There is hope and it must not be suppressed. My sadness can relax and take it easy because the support of joy is also there to support me. It gives a peace of mind. There is always a smart route. Be objective and not subjective. Self disciplin is important. Accept what you can't control. You can have influence by controlling yourself. Focus on what you can control. Learn from your opponents. Find potential partners and take the one which is like you. Everything ends up being surpassed. Don't let the same people disappoint you twice. Someone else's progress does not diminish your progress. Don't react, boycott them with silence. Your brain is the strongest muscle, so train it a lot. Better days are coming, you won't wake up forever with a heavy heart. Hard times always reveal true friends. Take care of your body. Remember that health is another form of wealth. Be alone until you are appreciated. Sometimes you have to go through the worst to get the best. No matter how hard a past, you can always start over. You alone are enough, you don't have to prove anything to anyone. Never forget who helped you in the hard times. Patience is your ally. Your vision will be blurred, but it will become visible in time. You deserve everything, so respect and appreciate everything. There are many who love you, so don't focus on those who don't. Accept what is, let what was go, and have hope for what will be. A negative mind never gives a positive life. Be calm when you've been through it before, because you've been through it before. It is only you who has to make sure you are happy. Money is a tool. Freedom is the goal. Not telling others everything is self-care. Time separates you from others, so enjoy the moments. Time reveals who means what to whom. Remember, something has to end for something better to begin. Be careful who you trust, salt and sugar are similar. Seek respect not attention, it lasts longer. There is always someone who doesn't recognize your worth, don't let it be you. No regrets just do better next time. Let go of the wrong people so you meet the right people. Forgive yourself, you have changed. Don't give up when it's hard, but find a smart solution if there is one otherwise work hard. Show will, but do not willfully create others. You always have to work hard to be successful. Tell only those closest and trustworthy with good confidence about life. If it gives you pleasure, be quiet about it. No one is too busy, it's all about priorities. It's your mind, control it or someone else will. There may be good moments even in the future, so get ready. Be independent as much as possible. You don't go back in time. Be proud of yourself for your hard work. Everyone can cause pain so focus on those who's worth it. Work on yourself for yourself. Visualize steps for an action to become a habit. Strengthen the right will. Always be critical. Train your body and mind. Practice imagining having it and letting it go. Practice detachment. Accept your weaknesses and strengths. Always prepare instead of preconceived. Seek serenity. Change the behavior to this. Prejudice is ignorance and sometimes arrogance. I cannot change people, but they change themselves, and I can influence that change. Train empathy. One thing at a time, for full concentration. Remember to breathe deeply a few times. Feelings and problems should only be shared with those most trusted. Learn from mistakes. Problems and setbacks are opportunities to learn. Be grateful. It is important. Smart goals not just goals. Steps to experience success. Always choose the wisest solution. Self management is important. I have to live in the present, but plan for the future when it comes. Self control is important. Practice makes mastery.


Alternative: 
Routine to rehab: Read and think "Your thoughts come by itself, with concentration it can come by with effort." Keep the common world in thought. Meditate every day with positive and constructive sentences. Every perspective has a meaning likewise has world views. Hallucinations can be expression for feelings or thoughts. Remember that it just can, it's not always right. Dissociations are thoughts from fantasy, meanwhile visual thoughts can be imaginative and relatable. Reflect before sleep and after about what has happened in the real world. Remember to remember the real world and train your brain without exhausting, but have energy enough for the day. Focus to change bad habits and keeping good habits. Listen to positive vibes and positive or neutral music instead bad or something, that has a bad influence. Keep remembering true good moments. Keep track of your own body language and your feelings. Note down abnormalities and check if their are abnormalities, but only if it's convenient. Keep remembering the true world and don't do harm unless it's necessary. Keep remembering that you are yourself and that only you can control yourself. Take care of yourself with hygiene and nutrition. Drink enough water every day. Meditate by closing your eyes and focusing on only your breathing for 20 minutes every day. Documentate wrong assumptions and conclusions and solve it. Listen to tones from 8 hz to 14 hz in a loop. Try online visualization scripts. If you lose control imagine your body where it is. Train your mind again with small tasks, it doesn't matter what it is, just work your mind to a good balance. Play games to reinforce your skills and abilities and be in a positive social circle to reinforce yourself and your personality.

So it this you?
So please tell me, am I sick? Will I die without knowing and still be more stressed with anxiety and fear. I don't do a lot to go against it, so if I die then I die without honor but as an idiot without good reasons. Loss of potential, more risks, more danger and all of it unnecessary.
